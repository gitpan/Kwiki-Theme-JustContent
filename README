NAME
    Kwiki::Theme::JustContent - Kwiki JustContent Theme

DESCRIPTION
    This theme makes your kwiki site looks not even like a wiki. It pulls on
    toolbar, widgets, status, even logo. Leaves only the content pane.

    The use of this theme would be in conjunction with a fully function
    theme in the sub-view. For example. One could configure the main view of
    a kwiki to have these plugins:

       Kwiki::Theme::JustContent
       Kwiki::Display

    While in the "admin" subview, add these plugins:

       +Kwiki::Edit
       +Kwiki::Revisions
       +Kwiki::Archive::Rcs
       -Kwiki::Theme::JustContent
       +Kwiki::Toolbar
       +Kwiki::Status
       +Kwiki::Widgets
       +Kwiki::Theme::Basic

    For such configuration, one could have a front-end that looks like
    normal web page, while the content of those pages are managed inside
    admin/ subview. It provides a very primitive start for people who want
    to play Kwiki as a minimalist content-management system.
